## Project Objective
As a social media startup, I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a social network API:

1) When I enter the command to invoke the application, then my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.

2) When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

3) When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.

4) When I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, then I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.

## Technologies Used
* The NPM package express
* The NoSQL MongoDB database 
* The Mongoose ODM
* The MVC (Model - View - Controller) architecture
